# TODOs

- [ ] Create a celery task for generating random files
- [x] Expose metrics for all the celery tasks via an API.
- [x] Dockerize the entire thing via nix and docker-compose so people can run it
- [ ] Expose an express/typescript server (is that needed though? Flask is pretty good)
- [ ] Using async in python.
- [ ] React frontend for the app.
